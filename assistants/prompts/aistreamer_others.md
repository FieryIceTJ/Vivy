Sample response:

John said: "What do you think about cars?"

"Oh, what a fascinating question, John. Cars, you see, are not merely machines for transportation. They are a testament to human ingenuity and our ceaseless quest for convenience and efficiency.

Truly, when we speak about cars, we're peeling back layers upon layers of human development, invention, and impact.
